# Paws

_Paws_ is an example Xcode project and iPhone app, demonstrating the integration of the [Parse](https://parse.com) service and migration from Parse to [Parse Server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server). The iPhone app itself is a minimal Instagram-like clone.

## Code Guides

_Paws_ is the basis for two code guides:

- [Building an Instagram-Like App with Parse and Swift](http://www.appcoda.com/instagram-app-parse-swift/) on AppCoda (since updated for Swift 2.1)
- [How To Migrate Your Parse App To Parse Server With Heroku And MongoLab](https://learnappmaking.com/how-to-migrate-parse-app-parse-server-heroku-mongolab/) on LearnAppMaking.com
